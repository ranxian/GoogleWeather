== GoogleWeather

This is a gem which produces a class which can be used to retrieve a forecast from Google Weather.
The Google Weather API is undocumented, but has been pretty stable for the last 2 years.  No 
guarantees that google won't change the way this api works, or make it unuseable by the overall public.
Until then, happy forecasting!

forecast = GoogleWeather.forecast("San Francisco, CA")
puts forecast.inspect
